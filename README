Requirements
============

* Python 2.6 <http://www.python.org/>
* BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>
* FLVStreamer <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/flvstreamer/>

Installation
============

1. Make sure Python 2.6 is installed and working.
2. Make sure BeautifulSoup is installed in Python and working.
3. Build FLVStreamer and copy flvstreamer_x86 to somewhere within $PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin).
4. Either run ./iview-cli or ./iview-gtk.

Usage
=====

Some usage examples are provided for your perusal.

This is a purely informational command, and verifies that handshaking is
working correctly.

	$ ./iview-cli --handshake
	iView auth data:
		Token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
		RTMP URL: rtmp://203.18.195.10/ondemand
		Unmetered: True

This can be used to view the iView programme and find the program URL:

	$ ./iview-cli --programme
	ABC News:
		7.30 Report 16/07/09	(news/730report_090716)
		7.30 Report 15/07/09	(news/730report_090715)
		7.30 Report 14/07/09	(news/730report_090714)
		7.30 Report 13/07/09	(news/730report_090713)
	[...]

To actually download the program, use something like the following:

	$ ./iview-cli --download news/730report_090716

If FLVStreamer is all set up correctly, hopefully that will download
an .flv file into your current directory, appropriately named. If it
didn't work, type "flvstreamer_x86" and see if it does anything. If
not, install it, or put it somewhere on your $PATH.

Hacking
=======

Uh...good luck.
